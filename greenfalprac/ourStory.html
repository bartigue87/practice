          I never thought that one day I would actually inherit a gold mine!
        </p>

          Yes folks, my family’s closely-held and carefully-guarded falafel
          recipe is by far THE BEST FALAFEL EVER!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          The story is told that my great grandmother in Bethlemem came into
          possession of the recipe. Realizing just how delicious this falafel
          was, she kept it guarded in her recipe book as a family heirloom.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1972 this family heirloom was passed down to my parents, Karimeh
          and Suhail. My father, being an entrepreneur, opened a falafel shop in
          Jordan which became hugely successful.

          Coming to America was a dream my father pursued for many years. He
          made it here, but sadly, his dream of a falafel shop in the U.S. was
          not fulfilled and he passed away shortly after immigrating.
        </p>
        <p>
          After my military service, I got involved in many businesses, but I
          was still preocupied by my childhood memories of my father’s shop and
          the amazing food cooked there. Having an entrepreneurial streak
          myself, I set out to fulfill my father’s dream of bringing his brand
          of middle-eastern cuisine to the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016 The Green Falafel was born as a pop-up tent in California.
          Customers’ responses were overwhelming, so naturally, we upgraded to a
          food truck. To meet our customers’ demands, we added our
          mouth-watering Middle Eastern kabab as a meat option. With the
          addition of kabab to the menu, we changed our name to The Green
          Falafel & Kabab.
        </p>
        <p>
          At The Green Falafel & Kabab we have focused our energy on perfecting
          a few classic menu items to ensure freshness and quality in every
          bite.
